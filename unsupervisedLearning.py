# i feel we need a neural network here
# we will pass 3  params(G1,G2,failures)
# will have 2 layers and we will have how many outputs?
# one option is we define 3 grade range and our model outputs one of them
# this gives us 3 groups of people we get who needs help and who doesnt need much and who are doing absolutely fine

# we start with some random weights for the architecture
# we let the model guess what value should it give
